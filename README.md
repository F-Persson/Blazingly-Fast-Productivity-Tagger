# Tagger

The Tagger is a Chrome extension that simplifies the usage of bookmarks and notes.

## Usage
It is my first Angular project, designed to gain knowledge about the framework.

## How to

To use Tagger, mark the desired text on any webpage (optional) and press "ctrl + left mouse click." A pop-up window will appear, allowing you to save the text and URL, with the option to add tags for that site. To access your bookmarks and notes, press "ctrl + right mouse click."

## TODO

### Rewrite all the code to make it follow some kind of best practice. Post-development and any troubles in Dev.to.

### Create a backend (preferably using C#) to store all users' tags. If the same URL is posted multiple times, add +1 to the "all tags" area and give the option to see which tags have the most "+" within a specific time period, such as today, this week, or this month.

### Allow login to save your tags.

### Sort tags by date.

### In the options page, show how many times the tag has been tagged, upvoted, or downvoted.
