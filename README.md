## Usage
My first Angular project, made for gaining knowledge about the framework. 

## What is it
Tagger is a Chrome extension to simplify the usage of bookmark and notes. 

## How to
Mark text on any page (optional)
press "ctrl + left mouse click" - you'll get a popup to save the text and url, with option to add tags for that site.

To access your bookmarks and notes, press "ctrl + right mouse click".

## TODO

#### Backend (preferable C#) that stores all users tags. If the same url is posted multiple times - add +1 in the all tags area and give the option to see which tags has the most + within a specifc time. Today, this week, month etc.

#### Make login possible to save your tags

#### sort tags by date

#### In options page - show how many times it has been tagged and upvoted or downvoted
